# Collecting-data-from-Invoice
The primary extraction method for this project is a Hybrid Parsing Strategy that combines Positional Text Scraping with Regular Expression (Regex) Pattern Matching. This approach first converts the PDF into a structured list of text lines, allowing the script to use specific "Markers" or headers, such as "Sold By" or "Billing Address," as logical anchors to identify where a data block begins. For multi-line sections like addresses, the code uses Relative Indexing to capture the subsequent lines while employing Boundary Logic to stop extraction immediately upon hitting metadata keywords like "PAN," "GST," or "State," which prevents data from different sections from mixing together.

Complementing this positional logic, the script utilizes Regex Pattern Matching to extract highly specific alphanumeric strings that may shift positions between different invoice layouts, such as the order_number or the complex invoice_details code. By using patterns that target non-space characters (\S+) and case-insensitive anchors, the method ensures that identifiers are captured in their entirety regardless of minor formatting variations. Finally, the extracted data is standardized through string cleaning—removing asterisks and joining vertical lines with commas—and then Transposed using a pandas DataFrame to match the vertical column structure required by the final output template.
